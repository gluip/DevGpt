The task "Create a new project" has failed because it attempted to overwrite existing files. The console output suggests to run the command again with the '--force' option in order to overwrite the files and create the project. Therefore, the task status should be updated to "failed" and a new task should be added to the TASK_LIST to run the command with the '--force' option. The modified TASK_LIST in chronological order is as follows:

TASK_LIST=[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "task": "Create a new project",
    "command": "execute_shell",
    "dependent_task_ids": [],
    "status": "failed",
    "arguments": [
      "dotnet new console -o myApp"
    ],
    "result": "Failed to create the project because it attempted to overwrite existing files"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "task": "Create a new project with force",
    "command": "execute_shell",
    "dependent_task_ids": [],
    "status": "pending",
    "arguments": [
      "dotnet new console -o myApp --force"
    ],
    "result": "not yet run"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "task": "Compile the project",
    "command": "execute_shell",
    "dependent_task_ids": [
      2
    ],
    "status": "pending",
    "arguments": [
      "dotnet build myApp"
    ],
    "result": "not yet run"
  }
