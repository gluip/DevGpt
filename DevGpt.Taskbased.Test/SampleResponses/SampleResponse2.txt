Based on the RESULT, the command "dotnet new console -o myApp --force" executed successfully. So, the status of the task with id 0 should be updated to "completed" and the result should be updated with the output of the command. The TASK_LIST after this update would be:

```
TASK_LIST=[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "task": "Create a new project",
    "command": "execute_shell",
    "dependent_task_ids": [],
    "status": "completed",
    "arguments": [
      "dotnet new console -o myApp --force"
    ],
    "result": "The template \"Console App\" was created successfully. Processing post-creation actions... Restoring C:\\git\\DevGpt\\DevGpt.Taskbased\\bin\\Debug\\net6.0\\myApp\\myApp.csproj: Determining projects to restore... All projects are up-to-date for restore. Restore succeeded."
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "task": "Compile the project",
    "command": "execute_shell",
    "dependent_task_ids": [
      0
    ],
    "status": "pending",
    "arguments": [
      "dotnet build myApp"
    ],
    "result": "not yet run"
  }
] ###END###
```

The next task to be run is the one with id 1, "Compile the project", as it is now the first task with status "pending".
